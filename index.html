                    <h2> How We came to BEE: </h2>
                    <p> On the eve of a particularly trying day our founder, Bill Durr, went out for a long walk and stopped to smell the roses. 
                        Unfortunately the rose he decided to smell contained a tiny little menace who flew into his nose and stung him. From that 
                        day on, he swore not only to take revenge on that vile species, but to bring the sweet fruit of his labour to the masses.
                        And so, Bill's Bees was born. Our company seeks to bring you the highest quality honey, made from the succulent ichor of 
                        mashed bees.</p>

                            <p>Our bees are one hundred percent wild, making our honey the most natural in the world!
                                While we could be farming them, this would be in conflict with our mission to erase all bees.

                            <p>Not only does this allow up to eliminate large amounts of bees, it makes the surrounding area uninhabitable
                                for any future bee colonies. We burn just enough to kill them, but not so much as to incinerate them.
